The Department of Revenue proposes to rescind and reserve rule 701 17.4(422,423) and amend rule 701 226.6(423) to provide accuracy and clarity to the Department's rules. The amended rule 701 226.6(423) states that sales of commercial fertilizer are exempt from sales and use tax, and plant hormones are considered to be commercial fertilizer. Additionally, sales of agricultural limestone are exempt from sales and use tax only if the purchaser intends to use it for disease control, weed control, insect control, or health promotion of plants or livestock produced for market as part of agricultural production. The measure also amends subrule 18.5(7) to update a cross reference to rule 701 17.4(422,423). Furthermore, the measure provides examples of taxable use of commercial fertilizer and agricultural limestone, including sales for application on a lawn, golf course, or cemetery. The Department also proposes to amend subrule 18.57(1) to exempt sales of fertilizer, limestone, herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, plant food, and medication for use in disease, weed, insect control, or other health promotion of flowering, ornamental, or vegetable plants to a commercial greenhouse from tax. This measure has an effective date of: no date provided.", "timestamp": 1740981411.2589004, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free"}
