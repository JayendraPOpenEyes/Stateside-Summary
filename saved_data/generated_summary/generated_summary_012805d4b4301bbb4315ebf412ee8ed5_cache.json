{"text_hash": "012805d4b4301bbb4315ebf412ee8ed5", "summary": "The Iowa Revenue Department is proposing amendments to rules regarding sales and use tax for commercial fertilizer. This action follows a petition received on April 16, 2018, which requested a change to an existing exemption rule. The proposed changes include rescinding an outdated rule (701 17.4) and amending another (701 226.6) to provide clarity and accuracy in line with recent legislative updates, particularly those conforming to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. The amendments will not have a fiscal impact or affect jobs in the state. Public comments on the proposal are invited until August 7, 2018, and can be submitted to Tim Reilly at the Department of Revenue. No public hearing is currently scheduled, but one may be requested if enough interest is shown. The proposed actions include updates to tax exemptions for sales of fertilizer and agricultural limestone based on their intended use.", "timestamp": 1741008007.2887223, "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
