(1) No heavy-duty vehicle powered by a 1991 or subsequent model-year diesel engine operating within the State of California shall exceed 40 percent smoke opacity when tested in accordance with this section unless its engine is exempted under subsection (c) or (d) below. (2) No heavy-duty vehicle powered by a pre-1991 model-year diesel engine, operating on the highways within the State of California, shall exceed 55 percent smoke opacity when tested in accordance with this section unless its engine is exempted under subsection (c) or (d) below. (b) Exemptions (1) The Executive Officer shall exempt from subsections (a)(1) and (2) any engine family that is shown by the engine manufacturer to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer to exhibit smoke opacity greater than 40 percent or 55 percent respectively when in good operating condition and adjusted to the manufacturer's specifications. Such engine family(s) must comply with any technologically appropriate less stringent opacity standard identified by the Executive Officer based on a review of the data obtained from engines in good operating condition and adjusted to manufacturer's specifications. Page 9 (2) The Executive Officer shall exempt from subsections (a)(1) and (2) any 1991 and earlier model-year heavy-duty diesel engines that are equipped with carryover add-on aftermarket turbocharger kits approved by the ARB, and are shown by the kit or engine manufacturer to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer to exhibit smoke opacity greater than 40 percent or 55 percent respectively when in good operating condition and adjusted to manufacturer's specifications. Such engines must comply with any technologically appropriate less stringent opacity standard identified by the Executive Officer based on a review of the data obtained from engines in good operating condition and adjusted to manufacturer's specifications. (3) Exemptions previously issued and in effect on January 1, 1996 shall remain in effect under the amendments to this section adopted on March 2, 1998 and effective on May 4, 1998.

(c) Effect of missing emission control label on applicable standard. When the owner of a heavy-duty diesel-powered vehicle receives a Citation or written notification from the CARB that the emission control label was missing during an inspection, the owner must replace the emission control label and provide the engine number identification to the CARB within 45 days of receipt of the notification Citation in addition to paying applicable penalties under section 2185(a)(3). If the owner fails to comply with this requirement, it will be conclusively presumed in any subsequent smoke opacity test where the emission control label remains missing that the vehicle is subject to the 405 percent smoke opacity standard in section 2182(a)(1), (2), unless at the time of the subsequent test it is plainly evident from a visual inspection that the vehicle is powered by a pre-1991 model-year engine. (d) Excessive Smoke. A heavy-duty vehicle has excessive smoke, as that term is used in the California Health and Safety Code section 44011.6, if it fails to comply with the applicable smoke opacity standard applicableunder this section 2182(a). (e) Tactical military vehicles, as described in title 13, CCR, section 1905, are exempt from the requirements of this chapter.
