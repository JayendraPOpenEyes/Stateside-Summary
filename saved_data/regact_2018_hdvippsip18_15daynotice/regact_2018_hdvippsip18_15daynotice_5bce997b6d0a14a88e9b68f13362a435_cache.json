Notably, section 2180.1(a)(5) now requires vehicle owners to demonstrate compliance upon receiving a citation, clarifying their responsibilities. Additionally, new definitions for \"implement of husbandry\" and \"specialty farm vehicle\" have been added in sections 2180.1(a)(19) and 2180.1(a)(37), respectively, which allows for extended repair times for these vehicles. An exemption for tactical military vehicles has been included in section 2182(e), acknowledging their unique operational requirements that may prevent compliance with standard emissions controls. Furthermore, section 2185(a)(1)(D) offers additional time for owners of implements of husbandry and specialty farm vehicles to complete repairs if cited for opacity violations, addressing concerns about operational downtime during critical agricultural periods. The PSIP also reflects similar exemptions for tactical military vehicles in section 2190(b)(8). Additional provisions in section 2193(c) establish record-keeping requirements for vehicle sales and introduce multiple exemptions from opacity testing upon sale for vehicles sold to brokers, out-of-state buyers, for dismantling, between lessors and lessees, and to family members, thus streamlining the process and aligning it with existing regulations. This measure has an effective date of: [date].", "timestamp": 1741008734.1968384, "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
